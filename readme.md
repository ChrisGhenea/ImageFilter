PhoneGap / Cordova Image Filter Plugin
===

This plugin was inspired by [Drew Dahlman's](https://github.com/DrewDahlman) [ImageFilter plugin](https://github.com/DrewDahlman/ImageFilter) for iOS and Android but expanded a great deal to include image resizing, and rotation.

There are more filters and borders which can be applied independently of one another.
